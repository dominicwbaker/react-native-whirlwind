Whirlwind uses semantic color names. While this seems counterintuitive considering that Whirlwind uses utility classes instead of semantic class names, this has shown advantageous for several reasons: When developing commercial products in which the application designs are created by a design team, we are typically using a limited set of colors based on an external branding guideline. The use of `primary` and `secondary` as color names allows tweaking the branding without having to go back and change the shade of the colors throughout the codebase again. And the use of a limited set of semantic color names also more easily enforces a consistent set of colors throughout the application.
